# Activity: Clean a sample dataset

* Individually or in small groups. Could also be a large group walkthrough. 
* Select a small dataset that needs to be cleaned. Or, find a cleaned/structured dataset and add some issues to the dataset. Note that you have made alterations to the original dataset if you select the second option. 
* Ask attendees to clean the dataset while documenting along the way. Can be done using a specialized tool, such as OpenRefine, or Google Sheets or Excel. 
* Discussion questions: 
  * What were some trends that you noticed in the dataset that you had to address in cleaning? 
  * What were some of the challenges you encountered? Where did those challenges originate (dataset, tool, skills, etc.)? 

## Total recommended time

* 45-60 minutes

## Tools/materials required

* Data cleaning software
* Simple, interesting dataset that needs to be cleaned
* Computers for each participant or group
