# Activity: Chart Makeover Walk-Through

* Select a chart makeover project with several versions of a chart as it goes through a redesign
* As a large group, discuss each version of the chart:
  * (except for first version) What changes has the designer made since the last version of this chart?
  * What works well with this chart?
  * What are some potential concerns with this chart?
  * How might we address the concerns?
