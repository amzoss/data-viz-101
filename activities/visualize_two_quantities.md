# Activity: Visualize Two Quantities

* Based on [45 Ways to Communicate Two Quantities](https://rockcontent.com/blog/45-ways-to-communicate-two-quantities/)
* Display two quantities (e.g., **37** and **75**) to the full group
* Individually or in small groups, brainstorm all of the ways of visualizing the two quantities
* Report back to the group to try to list all of the options found across all individuals/groups
* Display the 45 options from the blog post, or a subset that represent the most unusual options

## Total recommended time

* 15-20 minutes (10 minutes to brainstorm, 5-10 to report back)

## Tools/materials required

* A way for individuals or groups to sketch out the options - either on paper or using some kind of collaborative sketching software, like [SketchTogether](https://sketchtogether.com/)
