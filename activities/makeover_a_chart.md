# Activity: Makeover a Chart

* Split into groups of 2-4
* Each group gets one chart
* Groups redesigns chart
    * Option A: groups sketch out the redesign informally, either on paper or using some kind of collaborative sketching software, like [SketchTogether](https://sketchtogether.com/) or [Miro](https://miro.com/)
    * Option B: groups are given the actual chart file in a software application they know how to use (e.g., Google Sheets) and they redesign the chart in this tool in the time allotted
* Groups share before/after with wider group and explain why they made the decisions they did

## Total recommended time

* 45-60 minutes

## Tools/materials required

* Simple charts with obvious design elements that could be improved
* If using visualization software to redesign chart, at least one computer per group
* If sketching in person, blank paper and pens, colored pencils, markers, etc.
* If virtual, breakout rooms for groups
