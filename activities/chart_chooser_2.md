# Activity: Which charts would you choose? (Version 2)

* Display sample charts to full class.
* Ask the class / create poll questions: 
  * Which chart should you use if you were tracking:
    * Disease spread over time? \[Line. Why? Able to show continuous data]
    * Each student’s favorite color within a class? \[Pie or Bar]
    * Number of students per course at a University?  \[Bar. Why can’t you use pie? Because students are in multiple courses so they don’t represent a whole when added together]

Note: substitute the charts and questions with your favorite line, bar, and pie charts or those that are related to the audience’s interests
