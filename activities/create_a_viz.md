# Activity: Create a visualization

* Groups of 2-3
* Select a lightweight data visualization tool (ex. [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) or [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/))
* Provide a clean, interesting dataset (ex. Excerpt of the [NYC Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw), [Seattle Cultural Space Inventory](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Seattle-Cultural-Space-Inventory/vsxr-aydq), etc.)
* Walk through some basics of the tool
* In small groups, create a visualization (20-30 minutes). Share out with the rest of the session attendees.

  * What were some of the challenges you encountered when visualizing this data?
